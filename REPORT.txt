- Propose a design for implementing copy-on-write shared mappings

A design for copy-on-writing for shared mappings is that all non writes of the shared mapping will point to the correct page in the page cache.
Since using a PMAP, we can determine how many children are sharing a certain page, allowing us to know if that page is shared or private. Upon 
a page fault to attempt to write to our read only page (and once we determine its a shared page), we copy that page to a new mapping (with write 
premissiosn) and update the pmap. We set the correct information corerctly, and we have COW shared mappings. Just when we need to Copy (but not write) it, we'll 
update the mapping to shared and update the mappings properly.
